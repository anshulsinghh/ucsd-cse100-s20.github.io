This course will focus on high-performance data structures and supporting
algorithms. You will use and implement of data structures like (un)balanced
trees, graphs, priority queues, and hash tables. You will also learn how to
make sophisticated use of memory management, pointers, and recursion in
programs, and analyze them with theoretical and practical performance
analysis.

We will explore these topics interactively in lecture, you will implement
programs to practice your programming skills, and you will reflect on this
learning through your own program designs.

This web page serves as the main source of announcements and resources for the
course, as well as the syllabus.

<a id="b:lec"></a>

<h3>Lecture</h3>

Content in the course will be mostly delivered via pre-recorded videos and
the Stepik textbook. In the normally-scheduled lecture sections, you will
work in groups to complete challenge problems related to the homework and
programming assignments, with Q&A and guidance from the instructors.
(Virtual) attendance at the scheduled lecture sections is not required, but
it is encouraged. You're also encouraged, but not required, to virtually
attend the lecture section for which you are enrolled.

<h3>Exams</h3>

The course will have a midterm exam and a final exam, both of which will be
given asynchronously and electronically. Exams will allow the use of notes,
readings, and other online resources. You **cannot** collaborate with other
students on exams, as they are individual assessments.

The midterm will be have its exam time centered on Wednesday, April 29. The
final exam will have its exam time centered on Thursday, June 11. Detailed
instructions will be released with the exams, but you should make sure that
you have **three hours free some time the day of the exam** in which you can
focus and complete an examination that may require fairly continuous internet
access during that time. We'll release more detailed hours as we get
information about the time zones in the class and availability of students,
but this is a good overall schedule you should plan for.

Exams will use Canvas or Gradescope test-taking features.

<a id="schedule"></a>
## Schedule

The schedule below outlines topics, due dates, and links to assignments. In a
typical week, by 5pm Monday before class all due dates, readings, and notable
events in the course until the following week will be posted here. So if you
check the schedule at the beginning of the week, you'll know when all reading
quizzes, programming assignments, etc. will be due. We will often have the
schedule confirmed more than a week out, but we'll always be at least a week
ahead.

There are dozens of staff to help with your learning, and a few kinds of help
sessions you can attend.

The first is **office hours**, held by TAs and instructors at the times
listed below. Office hours are a great place for any kind of question about
the course, from help with your assignment to clarifications about material
in lecture to questions beyond what we cover in the course.

Since we're remote, there are some logistics to consider for office hours. We
typically offer office hours as a **group activity** – more than one person
can be in our office getting help and participating in discussion at a time.
That will also be the case with remote hours. You can click on any of the
Calendar events below to see a corresponding Zoom link that you can join.
When you join you'll initially be in a waiting room – think of this as like
being outside the office right before we tell you to come in. We'll usually
admit you pretty quickly, and then you can ask any questions you have as they
fit into the ongoing group discussion.

If you have a private question, you can send a chat message directly to the
TA or instructor in the room that you have a question that needs to be asked
privately. Examples of private questions are those about grades or a personal
situation that requires a special accommodation. We will arrange for part of
the time to be just you in the room (moving others to the waiting room as
necessary). We would prefer that any questions about course content always be
asked to the group so that everyone can benefit from the resulting
discussion.

<iframe src="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=eng.ucsd.edu_ek97t08565rln137vq7fkjmfd0%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FLos_Angeles" style="border: 0" width="800" height="600" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>



The second is **open lab hours** where tutors give one-on-one help with
programming tasks and course content. For these sessions, you should submit a
ticket on [https://autograder.ucsd.edu](https://autograder.ucsd.edu) to
request help. There is an extra step since we are remote – along with your
ticket, you should submit a link to a Zoom meeting **that you create and
start**. The tutor will join that Zoom meeting, chat with you to help you
with your issue, and then leave the meeting. You can, for example, start a
screenshare with your code before the tutor arrives to help them immediately
see your issue and present what you're seeing.

[Can be TUTOR/TA TODO to fill this in, this is an update of the instructions
from last quarter]


<iframe src="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=eng.ucsd.edu_ah9di1m4nd06gfvd88kkjjpjl8%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FLos_Angeles" style="border: 0" width="800" height="600" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>

The third is **through Piazza**. Online discussion and Q&A for the class will
be available on Piazza: sign up to join the class here and view the
discussion forum here. Important announcements from the course team will be
pinned at the top of your feed. When you set up your account, you can select
the frequency for email notifications of messages and discussions on Piazza.

For each programming assignment, we'll make a frequently-asked questions
discussion on Piazza. You should refer to that during the assignment if you
get stuck or have questions come up; we'll use it to aggregate common issues.
You can feel free to comment publicly on those discussions, but do be
conscious that other students can see what you post, so posting solution code
for a project or an answer for a homework is an academic integrity violation.

The default is that posts are **private** to discourage accidentally
over-sharing solution code. If your post is a question about content,
lecture, course technology, logistics, etc, please do ask it publicly so
others can benefit from the answer.


Finally, you can always send a private message on Piazza to ask any question
about the course. Please don't message individual course staff privately
unless they've asked you to, and please don't message only the instructor
with a content question. The course staff as a whole works together to make
sure these messages get prompt responses (often by adding to the frequently
asked questions post).


<a id="grading"></a>
## Grading
Your grade will be calculated from:

- 44% homeworks (6-8 total)
- 16% engagement / quizzes (per-lecture/per-week)
- 20% programming projects (2 large projects)
- 20% exams (midterm and final exam combined)

### Homeworks

Homeworks will be a mix of programming tasks and specific questions about
data structures, and will be partially automatically graded and partially
graded by course staff. These will be released on a weekly basis for the
first part of the course.

<a id="p:engage"></a>
### Engagement

Each lecture comes with some quiz/engagement material, either Gradescope
online assignment or some steps to complete in Stepik. The required material
will be clearly labelled with each lecture. You must engage with at least **8
weeks'** worth of the required engagement material for a full score, and
engagement scores will be calculated on a week-by-week basis.

### Programming Projects

There will be two larger programming projects that are assigned in the later
part of the course. These will combine data structures knowledge you acquire
from class and homework with the pragmatics of writing a significant
application that demands high performance. These will be completed in a C++
programming environment that you will gain some practice with through
homeworks.

### Exams

The midterm and final combined are worth 20% of your grade:

- If your final exam score is higher than your midterm exam score, the final
counts for 15% and the midterm for 5%. This includes the case where you don't
complete the the midterm exam.
- If your final exam score is lower than your midterm exam score, the final
counts for 10% and the midterm for 10%. This includes the case where you
don't take the final exam.

You must take and pass at least one of the two exams to pass the course.


### Final Scoring

After your weighted average is calculated, letter grades will be assigned based
on the following grading scale:

<table class="table table-striped">
<tbody>
<tr align="center" padding="10">
<td>A+</td>
<td>A</td>
<td>A-</td>
<td>B+</td>
<td>B</td>
<td>B-</td>
<td>C+</td>
<td>C</td>
<td>C-</td>
<td>D, F</td>
</tr>
<tr align="center">
<td>&nbsp; >97&nbsp; </td>
<td>&nbsp; 93-96.99 &nbsp; </td>
<td>&nbsp; 90-92.99&nbsp; </td>
<td>&nbsp; 87-89.99&nbsp; </td>
<td>&nbsp; 83-86.99&nbsp; </td>
<td>&nbsp; 80-82.99&nbsp; </td>
<td>&nbsp; 77-79.99&nbsp; </td>
<td>&nbsp; 73-76.99&nbsp; </td>
<td>&nbsp; 65-72.99&nbsp; </td>
<td>&nbsp; Below 64.99&nbsp; </td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

We may adjust the above scale to be more lenient (depending on the overall
class performance), but we guarantee that we will not adjust the scale to make
it harder to get a better grade.

Note that for Spring 2020, all students have the option to take the P/NP
option for any or all of their courses, and can make the decision as late as
week 10. More information is available [in this memo from the CSE
department](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1e3CZtGzbf71WIGCjb_oPZ2XdXb4B-TKU/view)
so you can make the best decision for your situation.

<a id="policies"></a>
## Policies


### Academic Integrity

We have a [missive on academic integrity you must agree
to TODO update](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F6tu-82W5kFkEkZG8n4F7p-MLhyFVWLdPw5Tm1fABfM/edit?folder=1jNMUNlJuyXaOxDE5MdNNfRFARxfP40Rr#)
that details some examples of what we expect in terms of collaboration in the
course.

Note that with the course remote, one challenge we face as an instructional
team is verifying that students are submitting their own work. We typically
use exams to mitigate this particular challenge to academic integrity, since
it requires an in-person, ID-checked assessment. Assignments and exams will
come with specific policies for what types of collaboration is allowed, but
we have one course-wide policy – we may reach out to students to schedule a
check-in on their understanding of work they've submitted. We might do so at
random as a spot check, or because we notice something odd in a submission.
Your ability to describe your submitted work could be used as an additional
assessment and part of your grade.

We don't expect to use this option much (certainly **you** are a student that
acts with integrity!), but we state it clearly in the syllabus in case it
becomes necessary so it isn't a surprise to anyone.

You should be familiar with [the UCSD
guidelines](http://senate.ucsd.edu/Operating-Procedures/Senate-Manual/Appendices/2)
on academic integrity as well.

### Late Work

In general, late work is not accepted. However, most of the categories of
submission for the course allow some missed submissions without having a
large impact on your grade, and you only have to submit a subset of them for
full credit.

### Regrades

Mistakes sometimes occur in grading. Once grades are posted for an assignment,
we will allow a short period for you to request a fix (announced along with
grade release). If you don't make a request in the given period, the grade you
were initially given is final.


### Diversity and Inclusion

We are committed to fostering a learning environment for this course that
supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and respects
your identities (including race, ethnicity, heritage, gender, sex, class,
sexuality, religion, ability, age, educational background, etc.).  Our goal is
to create a diverse and inclusive learning environment where all students feel
comfortable and can thrive.

Our instructional staff will make a concerted effort to be welcoming and
inclusive to the wide diversity of students in this course.  If there is a way
we can make you feel more included please let one of the course staff know,
either in person, via email/discussion board, or even in a note under the door.
Our learning about diverse perspectives and identities is an ongoing process,
and we welcome your perspectives and input.

We also expect that you, as a student in this course, will honor and respect
your classmates, abiding by the UCSD Principles of Community
(https://ucsd.edu/about/principles.html).  Please understand that others’
backgrounds, perspectives and experiences may be different than your own, and
help us to build an environment where everyone is respected and feels
comfortable.

If you experience any sort of harassment or discrimination, please contact the
instructor as soon as possible.   If you prefer to speak with someone outside
of the course, please contact the Office of Prevention of Harassment and
Discrimination: https://ophd.ucsd.edu/.

### Consent to Participate in Educational Research
*University of California, San Diego  
Consent to Act as a Research Subject  
Investigating the Impact of Pedagogical Choices on University Student Learning and Engagement*

**Who is conducting the study, why you have been asked to participate, how you were selected, and what is the approximate number of participants in the study?**  
Gabriele Wienhausen, Director of the Teaching and Learning Commons, together with her education research colleagues is conducting a research study to find out more about how pedagogical choices affect student learning and experience in the classroom. You have been asked to participate in this study because you are a student in a class that is being studied or used as a control. There will be approximately 500,000 participants in this study.

**Why is this study being done?**  
The purpose of this study is to create knowledge that has the potential to improve the learning and educational experience of students at UC San Diego and beyond.

**What will happen to you in this study and which procedures are standard of care and which are experimental?**  
If you agree to be in this study, the following will happen:
Your data from this class including grades, homework and exam submissions, and survey responses will be included in the analysis to determine the effectiveness of the pedagogical techniques used in this course compared to other similar courses.

**How much time will each study procedure take, what is your total time commitment, and how long will the study last?**  
Your participation involves only agreeing to let us use your data in our analysis.  It will require no time on your part above the time you put into this course without agreeing to the study.

**What risks are associated with this study?**  
Participation in this study may involve some added risks or discomforts. These include the following:

1.   A potential for the loss of confidentiality.   We will not share your personally identifying data with people outside our research team.  Data will only be kept in anonymized form for research purposes.  Course data will not be used for this research study until after final grades have been posted and will be rendered confidential by removing any identifiers before analysis.  Your instructor will not know whether or not you are participating in this study until after final grades have been posted.  Data from students who opt out of the study will be removed prior to data analysis.  Research records will be kept confidential to the extent allowed by law. Research records may be reviewed by the UCSD Institutional Review Board.

Since this is an investigational study, there may be some unknown risks that are currently unforeseeable. You will be informed of any significant new findings.

**What are the alternatives to participating in this study?**  
The alternatives to participation in this study are not to participate.   If you choose to opt-out of participating in this research study, we will exclude your data from analysis.  Whether you participate will have no impact on your experience or grade in the associated class as the professor will not know who is or is not participating in the study until after final grades are assigned.

**What benefits can be reasonably expected?**  
There is no direct benefit to you for participating in the study. The investigator, however, may learn more about how to improve student learning, and society may benefit from this knowledge.

**Can you choose to not participate or withdraw from the study without penalty or loss of benefits?**  
Participation in research is entirely voluntary. You may refuse to participate or withdraw or refuse to answer specific questions in an interview or on a questionnaire at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which you are entitled. If you decide that you no longer wish to continue in this study before the end of the quarter, simply respond to the online opt-out form here: https://goo.gl/forms/JSBRjEmkES6W6xYc2.  If you decide to opt out after the quarter has ended, you must contact Laurel Nelson (laureln@ucsd.edu) and give the quarter and the course from which you would like your data withdrawn.
You will be told if any important new information is found during the course of this study that may affect your wanting to continue.

**Can you be withdrawn from the study without your consent?**  
The PI may remove you from the study without your consent if the PI feels it is in your best interest or the best interest of the study. You may also be withdrawn from the study if you do not follow the instructions given you by the study personnel.

**Will you be compensated for participating in this study?**  
You will not be compensated for participating in this study.

**Are there any costs associated with participating in this study?**  
There will be no cost to you for participating in this study.

 **Who can you call if you have questions?**
